# Install .NET SDK


Ceres is written in C# on the Microsoft .NET platform.
Install .NET 8.0 Runtime (or SDK) if not already installed.

On Windows install the appropriate installer from this page:
  https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0

On Linux (e.g. Ubuntu) use the package manager to install:
  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y dotnet-sdk-8.0

Hint: If you are not sure if .NET 8 is already installed, look for an entry beginning with "Microsoft.NETCore.App 8.*" from this command:
  dotnet --list-runtimes

Hint: Multiple versions of .NET can safely be installed side-by-side on the same system.
