Instructions to genrerate kernels (PTX from CU).
Needs 4 files from LC0 project 
  cuda_common.h
  winograd_helper.inc
  fp16_kernels.cu
  common_kernels.cu
NOTE: The above .cu files were trivially modified in one way: 
      all arguments accepting a stream were removed (sometimes also a template argument of 0).
      Optionally some of the instantiated template methods with type float can be removed to save space (not used).
Also one small file from Ceres
  ceres_kernels.cu

NOTE: Currently 40b is not working on pre-Ampere hardware (e.g. 2070).
      This could probably be fixed someday, but would require having two versions of the fp16_kernels (as was done before)
      with one having the fused implementation to allow up to 512 blocks instead of 384 (see cuda_common.h),
      and auto-selecting this alternate kernel (do not use special Ampere version) 
      only if on pre-Ampere hardware and only if running 40b.

Steps:
  1. Set the Visual Studio path via vcvars64.bat/vcvars64.cmd batch file provided by Microsoft
  2. Pull LC0 code from the LC0 project (and make the above referenced trivial changes).
  3. Create utils subdirectory under C:\dev\lc0\master1\lc0\src\neural\cuda and copy the LC0 utils source code files there (so CUDA compiler will find)
  4. Launch a console session from menu bar using "x64 Native Tools  Command Propmt for Visual Studio 2019"
  5. Change into directory where CU files are located
  6. Run the 3 commands to generate PTX and then copy to source code tree (update directory as needed).
  7. Rebuild C# project and test.

Working directory was: C:\dev\lc0\master1\lc0\src\neural\cuda.

NOTE: Initially "-arch=sm_70" was used but failed to run on 1080 GPUs. 
      Then switched to "-arch=sm_60" with no apparent loss of performance. But 1080 GPU does not work well (slow FP16).
      So switch back to "-arch=sm_70"

Batch file (go.cmd) which contains:
"C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.4\bin\nvcc.EXE" -ptx -o common_kernels.ptx  -c common_kernels.cu -arch=sm_70 -allow-unsupported-compiler
"C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.4\bin\nvcc.EXE" -ptx -o fp16_kernels.ptx  -c fp16_kernels.cu -arch=sm_70  -allow-unsupported-compiler
"C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.4\bin\nvcc.EXE" -ptx -o ceres_kernels.ptx  -c ceres_kernels.cu -arch=sm_70 -allow-unsupported-compiler

copy common_kernels.ptx C:\dev\Ceres\src\Ceres.Chess\NNBackends\CUDA\Kernels\PTX
copy fp16_kernels.ptx C:\dev\Ceres\src\Ceres.Chess\NNBackends\CUDA\Kernels\PTX
copy ceres_kernels.ptx C:\dev\Ceres\src\Ceres.Chess\NNBackends\CUDA\Kernels\PTX

rem TODO: someday maybe run for all possible kernels
